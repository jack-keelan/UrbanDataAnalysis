Work Flow Data Competition
Initial Data Parsing
Turn list mode into integrated data
Method
Take list mode data and integrate it into 4 or 8 Hertz spectral data files.  These files will then be used as input in the “Continued Data Parsing” below.
Scripts
* data_parsing.R
Input & Output
* main input is the raw list mode data:
o the “raw” list mode data energy & time delta by photon
o C:\Users\mooreet_la\projects\SDRD\competition\data\trainingData\listData
o C:\Users\mooreet_la\projects\SDRD\competition\data\testingData\listData1
* The file naming is different for the two input sets.
* Main output is the 4 or 8 Hertz data:
o Integrated spectra by channels (or other feature) in bins
o …\competition\data\trainingData\integrated_32Ch25s  (quarter second)
o …\competition\data\trainingData\integrated_32Ch125s (8th second)
o Same for ‘testingData’
Continued Data Parsing
Build the training, testing, & validation sets
Method
Scripts
Output
Model Building
Notes
1. Naming convention is that the data set given to us as “training data” is called training (model building) & testing (model building testing).  And the “testing data” is called validation data, used to score the methods.

1 See notes on the testing vs. training nomenclature.  Here the competition language is referenced, so trainingData here is training & testing data and the testingData is the validation data.
